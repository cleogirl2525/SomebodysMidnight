# SomebodysMidnight
Repo for Somebody's Midnight

SOMEBODY'S MIDNIGHT is an interactive, open love letter by SHAWNÉ MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY. Only accessible between midnight and 1AM (in each viewers’ unique timezone), the text becomes a call and response, asking viewers to reflect on old connections as we long, desire, wish, and hope from our isolation. In the end, like all communications, this one breaks down quickly, forcing us to either act quickly or revisit it in order to complete the transmission.
